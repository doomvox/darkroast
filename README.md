# The definitely unofficial Raku test suite

These are tests for the Raku programming language in addition to the
official "roast" tests.

This is a place to test aspects of the Raku programming language that
might not be so well covered by the roast tests.  You might think of
it as a test-bed for new tests.

This is intended to have a lower barrier to entry than the official tests--
feel free to ask to be added to the Contributors.


## the official Raku test suite

## motivation

The Raku project settled on the idea that "The tests are the spec."
That philosophy has a few issues, one of which is that it raises the 
barrier to entry for additional tests-- any attempt at improving 
coverage might inadvertanly change the definition of the language.
